LENDINGCLUB - ACCEPTED vs REJECTED ANOMALIES COMPARISON
Generated: 2025-12-17 11:28:51
================================================================================

DATASET COMPARISON:
• Accepted Loans: 2,260,639 applications (5.0% anomalies)
• Rejected Loans: 2,193,453 applications (5.0% anomalies)
• Time Period: 2007-06-01 to 2018-12-01 (both datasets)

KEY DIFFERENCES IN ANOMALIES:

1.  DTI VALUES (CRITICAL FINDING):
   • Rejected Anomalies: 59.0% have DTI > 100 (IMPOSSIBLE VALUES)
   • Accepted Anomalies: DTI capped at 100 during preprocessing
   • IMPLICATION: Data quality issues or fraud in rejected applications

2.  LOAN AMOUNTS:
   • Rejected Anomalies: $23,928 average (1.9x higher than normal rejected)
   • Accepted Anomalies: $22,031 average (1.5x higher than normal accepted)
   • IMPLICATION: Anomalies request larger loans in both groups

3.  EMPLOYMENT:
   • Rejected Anomalies: 61.1% have <1 year employment
   • Accepted Anomalies: Employment data shows varied patterns
   • IMPLICATION: Short employment history leads to rejection

4.  INCOME DATA:
   • Rejected Anomalies: Income data not available in dataset
   • Accepted Anomalies: $136,011 average (1.8x higher than normal)
   • IMPLICATION: High-income anomalies get accepted

BUSINESS ASSESSMENT:
 CREDIT SYSTEM IS WORKING: Correctly rejects impossible DTI applications
 DATA QUALITY ISSUE: DTI > 100 in rejected applications needs investigation
 ANOMALY DETECTION VALUE: Identifies edge cases for manual review

RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:
1. IMMEDIATE: Audit rejected applications with DTI > 100 (potential fraud)
2. SHORT-TERM: Implement DTI validation at application entry point
3. MEDIUM-TERM: Review employment criteria (may be too conservative)
4. LONG-TERM: Integrate anomaly detection into decision workflow

NEXT STEPS:
• Investigate root cause of DTI > 100 in rejected applications
• Compare anomaly patterns with actual fraud cases
• Implement real-time anomaly scoring in production
