LENDINGCLUB - ACCEPTED LOANS ANOMALY DETECTION
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Generated: 2025-12-17 10:35:25
================================================================================

EXECUTIVE HIGHLIGHTS:
  29.7% of anomalies are LOW FICO applicants (traditional credit risk)
  16.9% of anomalies have HIGH PUBLIC RECORDS (bankruptcy/legal issues)
  23.9% of anomalies are HIGH INCOME/HIGH LOAN applicants (potential fraud)
  29.5% of anomalies show complex patterns requiring investigation

BUSINESS IMPACT:
• 5% of loans flagged as anomalous
• Anomalies have 1.42x higher default rate (17.8% vs 12.6%)
• Captured 9.9% of total bad loan dollars ($448M)
• High Public Records segment has highest risk concentration

KEY RISK SEGMENTS:
1. HIGH PUBLIC RECORDS (16.9% of anomalies)
   • Bankruptcy flags and legal issues
   • Highest correlation with anomalies
   • Requires manual review

2. HIGH INCOME/HIGH LOAN (23.9% of anomalies)
   • Average income: $136K vs normal: $75K
   • Average loan: $22K vs normal: $14K
   • Potential income verification issues

3. LOW FICO (29.7% of anomalies)
   • Already identified by credit scoring
   • May indicate deteriorating credit

RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:
1. IMMEDIATE: Review all HIGH PUBLIC RECORDS anomalies
2. PRIORITY: Verify income for HIGH INCOME/HIGH LOAN anomalies  
3. MONITOR: Track performance of LOW FICO anomalies
4. INVESTIGATE: Analyze OTHER ANOMALY segment for new patterns

NEXT PHASE:
• Compare with rejected loans anomaly patterns
• Implement real-time anomaly detection
• Refine with supervised learning on outcomes
